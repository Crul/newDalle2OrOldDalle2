# "NEW" DALL-E 2 or "OLD" DALL-E 2

Play here: https://crul.github.io/newDalle2OrOldDalle2

## Instructions

- Press the **GREEN button** (or swipe left) if you think the image has been generated by DALL-E 2 **before 6th June, 2022**
- Press the **RED button** (or swipe right) if you think the image has been generated by DALL-E 2 **after 27th July, 2022**

## What is this?

[DALL-E 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DALL-E) is an artificial inteligence that generates images from text.

Some time ago some people noticed a drop in quality, but it's somehow controversial and not confirmed. This page is intended to serve as a test to see if people can tell the difference between the 2 periods: before 6th June, 2022 and after 27th July, 2022.

Disclaimer: I personally think this test can be easily biased because if people think the quality is lower they may be more inclined to share the bad examples instead the good ones.

This is a modification of a previous experiment ([r/dalle2 or /r/NotDALLE2 ?](https://crul.github.io/rDalle2OrRNotDalle2/)) suggested by [u/Wiskkey](https://www.reddit.com/r/dalle2/comments/w7k1ly/can_you_tell_the_difference_between_rdalle2_and/ii5rias/) who also provided the [Web Archive list from where the images were taken](https://web.archive.org/web/*/labs.openai.com/s*).

## Limitations

This is a personal project made just for fun. Don't expect a full app or game. Some limitations are:

- Images have been taken from [Web Archive](https://web.archive.org/web/*/labs.openai.com/s*) using the date value shown there. I'm not really sure if that's a reliable date to use as "generation date" because they could have been sent to Web Archive some time after the generation.
- There are 250 fixed images of each type (500 in total) taken on the 8th August 2022. If you answer all of them you will get a message.
- Because this page does not store or send any data you cannot save your score. All data will be lost on reload.
- Although this page keeps track of what images have been shown and avoids repetitions, the list of "already seen images" will reset if you close or reload it. So expect to see repetitions in that case.

## Keyboard controls

- O: Answer "OLD": the image has been generated **before** 6th June, 2022.
- N: Answer "NEW": the image has been generated **after** 27th July, 2022.
- W: Load New Image
- T: Show Title
- B: Previous image (Back)
- F: Next image (Forward)
- ?/H: Show Help
